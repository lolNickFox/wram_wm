This is the first pass at analyzing the wRAM working memory protocol in R.

```{r}

library(dplyr)
library(ggplot2)
library(broom)

help(read.csv)



setwd("C:/Users/Nick/Documents/GitHub/wram_working_memory")

wram_raw <- read.csv("wram_wm_raw.csv", header = TRUE, sep = ",")

wram_raw <- tbl_df(wram_raw)

wram_cleaned <- na.omit(wram_raw)

wram_averages <- wram_cleaned %>%
  dplyr::group_by(Day, Treatment, Trial) %>%
  dplyr::mutate(avr_RM_error = mean(RM_error), avr_WMC_error = mean(WMC_error)) %>%
  distinct(avr_RM_error, avr_WMC_error)

wram_averages %>%
  ggplot(aes(x = Trial, y = avr_WMC_error, group = Treatment, colour = Treatment)) + geom_point(alpha = 0.5, size = 2) + geom_line(size = 1) + facet_grid(. ~ Day) + theme_bw()
  
```
